## Shopping Cart
Welcome to my Shopping Cart project! This project is a simple shopping cart built with React and JSX. It allows users to browse a list of available products and seamlessly add them to their shopping cart. As products are added to the cart, the quantity of available products is updated in real-time, providing a dynamic and interactive shopping experience.

## Features

* Add to Cart: Click on a product to automatically add it to your shopping cart below.
* Real-time Quantity Update: The quantity of available products is updated in real-time as items are added to the cart.
* Responsive Design: The shopping cart is designed to work seamlessly on various devices.

## Technologies Used
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* JSX: A syntax extension for JavaScript, often used with React to describe what the UI should look like.

## Usage
